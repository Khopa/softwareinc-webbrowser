**OR** wait for publication on Steam workshop.

**About developing Web Browser in Software Inc :**

Using this mod, it is possible to start developing basic Web Browser in 1990. Additionally web browsers will require OS supporting networking, and this may restrict a bit your target audience in early 90s.
New technologies will be unlocked regularly along the years, allowing you to make your products evolve during all your game.

**Gameplay remarks :**

This may not be well balanced yet, and is subject to change. I wanted a mod that was both faithful to real world technologies and yet well integrated with Software Inc's gameplay.
Obviously, what takes the biggest amount of time is to play test it !
