**How to install ?**

Copy the folder src/WebBrowser in your Software Inc installation's Mod directory.

**OR** wait for publication on Steam workshop.

**About developing Web Browser in Software Inc :**

Using this mod, it is possible to start developing basic Web Browser by 1990. Additionally web browsers will require OS supporting networking, this may restrict a bit your target audience in early 90s.
New technologies will unlock regularly along the years, allowing you to make your products evolve during all your game.

**Gameplay remarks :**

This may not be well balanced yet, and is subject to change. I wanted a mod that was both realistic in regard to real world technologies and yet well integrated with Software Inc's gameplay.
Obviously, what takes the biggest amount of time is to play test it !
